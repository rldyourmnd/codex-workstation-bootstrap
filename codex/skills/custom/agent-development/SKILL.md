# Agent Development (Codex)

In Codex, favor skill-centric orchestration over product-specific subagent frameworks.

## Workflow
1. Decompose task into stable responsibilities.
2. Define clear handoffs and artifacts per step.
3. Encode repeatable behavior into skills and scripts.
4. Keep context boundaries explicit to reduce drift.
5. Measure outcomes and refine prompts/instructions.

## Deliverables
- Skill descriptions with strong trigger language.
- Reusable scripts/references.
- Checklist for execution and validation.
