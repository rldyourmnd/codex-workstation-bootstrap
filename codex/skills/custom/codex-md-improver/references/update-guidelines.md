# Update Guidelines (Codex)

## Add
- Verified commands and workflows.
- Non-obvious repo-specific constraints.
- Safety boundaries for destructive operations.

## Remove
- Generic advice.
- Stale file references.
- Legacy product-specific workflows not used by Codex.

## Optional CLAUDE.md Usage
Use `CLAUDE.md` only as secondary context for durable project knowledge.
Do not copy Claude plugin/hook runtime instructions into `AGENTS.md`.
